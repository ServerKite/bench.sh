An aeronautic benchmarking script that handles speed test from 30+ datacenters across the World. â€” No, it does not halt there. This script will be able to do more then that, of cource. I/O (Input / Output), SpeedTest.net tests and output the results via your terminal window.


### Structure Requirements
You should run this script as "root" access user and should install the mentioned applications below, before executing the bash file. 

The applications are as follows:

- IOPing
- GNU wget tool
- Python

### Colourful Suggestions & Ideas
Suggestions on making this script better are more then welcome. Would love to hear possible ways of improving the codes and structure.

### Transparency
ServerKite's bench.sh is a simple script based on Argiris Kamaras's linux server info script.
