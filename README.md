bench.sh
========

![ServerKite](http://i.imgur.com/HSMqAKD.png "ServerKite")

A benchmarking script that does speed test from 30+ datacenters across the World. â€” No, it does not halt there. This script will be able to do more then that, of cource. It handles I/O (Input / Output), SpeedTest.net tests and output the results via your terminal window.


### Requirements
You as a "root" access user, should install these applications first on your box, before executing this script. The applications are as follows:

- IOPing
- GNU wget tool
- Python

All of the application above should be ready-to-use, before executing "bench.sh" file.

### Suggestions & Ideas
Suggestions on making this script better are more then welcome. Would love to hear possible ways of improving the codes and structure.

### Transparency
ServerKite's bench.sh is a simple script based on Argiris Kamaras's linux server info script.
