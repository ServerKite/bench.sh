![ServerKite](http://i.imgur.com/HSMqAKD.png "ServerKite")

An aeronautic benchmarking script that handles speed test from 30+ datacenters across the World. â€” No, it does not halt there. This script will be able to do more then that, of cource. I/O (Input / Output), SpeedTest.net tests and output the results via your terminal window.


### Structure Requirements
You should run this script as "root" access user and should install the mentioned applications below, before executing the bash file. 

The applications are as follows:

- IOPing
- GNU wget tool
- Python

### Theory & Practice

Before pushing a new version or fixing some bits of codes, we usually take the script for a test drive. We utilized a few VPS providers, virtualizations and linux distributions. 

- RamNode (Atlanta, Georgia) OpenVZ SSD VPS with Debian 32-bit
- prgmr (San Jose, California) Xen VPS with CentOS 32-bit

### Colourful Suggestions & Ideas
Would love to hear possible ways of improving the codes, structure and aerodynamics. 

### Paper Transparency
ServerKite's bench.sh is a simple script based on Argiris Kamaras's linux server info script.
